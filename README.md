# gifted-project

by Sharon Kim, Dana Zhang, and Sheila Kelley

1. Technologies Used
   * CRA-Minimal for front-end and express, cors, dotenv, and mongoose/mongoDB for back-end
2. Approach taken
   * First made sure the server worked, then moved to the frontend and established the 7 RESTful routes, then styled, and finally made any necessory changes to the app. Throughout the project, we utilized a collaborative approach through constant communication via Slack and Zoom. 
3. Unsolved problems
   * When the user creates/updates an item, it resets back to the splash page, though they still worked.
   * The app isn't responsive to all devices
4. User stories
   * User should be able to create a profile for a person they have given a gift to. He/she should also be able to update/delete the profile, and view a gift history which is just basically gift log.
